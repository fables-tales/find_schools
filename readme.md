#Find schools

the schools subscribed people file is like a horrible mess of unparseable
junk yo. We did some things to try and make it work even better.

This script will spit out a postcode for each school that's subscribed but
there's a bunch of special cases. These may be normalised later yo!

usage is like this

    python find_postcodes.py [path_of_subscribed_people_file]
 

use it for epic winning
